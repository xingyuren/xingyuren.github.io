I am the Head of 3D Algorithms at [ExcitAI](https://excitai.com/), a rapidly growing startup specializing in generative AI technologies. My team is dedicated to developing cutting-edge solutions for human and animal reconstruction, aiming to create scalable, reliable digital assets that faithfully replicate real-world entities.

I earned my Ph.D. in 2025 from the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I conducted research in the [Vision and Learning](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/group.html) Group under Prof. [Chao Ma](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/). My doctoral work focused on face modeling and generation, including efficient geometry estimation and photorealistic texture synthesis, in collaboration with Prof. [Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/) and Prof. [Yichao Yan](https://daodaofr.github.io/).

Prior that, I worked at **Hytera** Communication Cooperation for a year in 2017. I received a bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (**HIT**) in 2016.
