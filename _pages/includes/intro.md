I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (**SJTU**). I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the [Vision and Learning](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/group.html) Group, supervised by Prof. [Chao Ma](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/). I have also worked with Dr. [Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/) and Prof. [Yichao Yan](https://daodaofr.github.io/). Currently, I am focusing on face modeling and generation (e.g., efficient geometry estimation and photorealistic texture modeling), with a special interest in generative AI and avatar creation.

Prior that, I worked at **Hytera** Communication Cooperation for a year in 2017. I received a bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (**HIT**) in 2016.
